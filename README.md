## Data Science Bits

Home for bits and pieces of code from various data science projects that I've worked on. Most of these relate to urban geography, travel behaviour, or transportation in some way or another. This is pretty much a collection of stuff that I want to have easy access to, but are too small to warrant their own repository.
